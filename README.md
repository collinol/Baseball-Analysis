# Baseball Data Analysis

## [How Salaries Compare](https://github.com/collinol/Baseball-Analysis/salaries.py)
A quick look at how US household incomes and MLB Player Salaries have increased over the years. Measured as cumulative percent change since 1985.

## [How Batting Performance Affects Salary](https://github.com/collinol/Baseball-Analysis/performance_vs_salary.py)
Here we take a look at four metrics of batters to see which has the most impact on salaries. 
The salary data is taken after two year's worth of the respective performance data. 
This gives us a look into how you can anticipate a player's salary to change in future years, given his current performance.

 While home runs are exciting and paying top dollar for a big hitter could be help drive a team's ticket sales,
 it makes sense that the correlation to an increased salary is slightly higher for RBI.
 Teams pay player's to help them win, and which performance metric is most vital to winning?
  Well, I'll let this quote from *MoneyBall* answer that.
 > Billy Beane: You get on base, we win. You don't, we lose. And I *hate* losing, Chavy. I *hate* it. I hate losing more than I even wanna win.



## [How Pitching Performance Affects Salary](https://github.com/collinol/Baseball-Analysis/performance_vs_salary.py)
In the same script, I took a similar look at how past pitching performance affected a player's current salary

Naturally, it makes sense that wins would be the highest indicator of an increased salary and 
a higher ERA would earn lower salaries,
but I found it interesting that innings pitched and strikeouts have similar correlations.
I guess neither of those metrics on their own tell you anything about how good a pitcher is. 
A lot of innings pitched doesn't tell you how good the pitcher was; 
and likewise, if a player threw 100 strikeouts, without knowing how many total pitches they threw, 
that information doesn't tell us much about the quality of the player.
